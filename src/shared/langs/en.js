  resume: `
  After 3 years in software development, the motivation behind my passion
  for software engineering is a strong belief that programming is a means
  for self-expression. When I design an app, I enjoy the process of
  finding code that is creative, elegant, and practical. I want to immerse
  myself in a community of people campaigning for innovation and
  collaboration. I have a customer service mindset with a strong bias
  toward action.
